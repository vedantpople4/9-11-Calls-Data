<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>In case you have issues getting the data because of your geographical location or Firewalls, I've uploaded a pickle file to this lecture as a resource. Its called "all_banks", once you've downloaded it, just use the following command to read it:</p>

<p><code>df = pd.read_pickle('all_banks')</code> <br></p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Jose</p>
