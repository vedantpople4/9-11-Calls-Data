# Basic ML Project 

### The first_project and second_project:
It contains Exploratery Data Analysis application and libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn and Matplotlib have been used. 
The projects potray plotting Graphs using seaborn, matplotlib and Data analysis, using dummy varibles and Data Cleaning methods to set up a usable and unbiased Dataset for Algorithms.
Datasets used in the projects above have also been uploaded.

### The LinearRegression_1 project:
It contains the notebook file that uses the USA Housing Dataset to predict the coefficents using the dependent variable 'Price' and the independent variable as 'No of Rooms','Poplulation,'Income','Area',etc.
Dataset used in the project above has also been uploaded.

### The LinearRegression_2 project:
It contains the notebook file that uses the Ecommerce dataset to predict the yearly amount spent by user on Ecommerce websites by using the 'Yearly Amount Spent' as the dependent varible and 'Time on App','Time on Web','Session Length'.
Dataset used in this project has been uploaded.

### The LogisticRegression_1 Project:
It contains the notebook file that uses the Titanic dataset to predict the assets of survived passengers by using the Passenger Class, Age, No of Siblings and Fare as independent variables. The data has to be cleaned before using and certain columns have to be removed as they have to many missing values.
Dataset has been uploaded for further refrence.

### The LogisticRegression_2 Project:
It contains the notebook file that uses the Advertising dataset to predict the that a user clicked on an Advertisement or not by using the Daily Time spent, Age, Are, Income, Daily Internet Usage and Gender as independent variables. 
Dataset has been uploaded for further refrence.

### The KNN_1:
It contains a notebook file thta uses the Classsified Data Dataset and implements K Nearest Neighbour Algorithm.
