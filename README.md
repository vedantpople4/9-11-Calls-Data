## ML Project 

### The first_project and second_project:
It contains Exploratery Data Analysis application and libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn and Matplotlib have been used. 
The projects potray plotting Graphs using seaborn, matplotlib and Data analysis, using dummy varibles and Data Cleaning methods to set up a usable and unbiased Dataset for Algorithms.
Datasets used in the projects above have also been uploaded.

### The LinearRegression_1 project:
It contains the notebook file that uses the USA Housing Dataset to predict the coefficents using the dependent variable 'Price' and the independent variable as 'No of Rooms','Poplulation,'Income','Area',etc.
Dataset used in the project above has also been uploaded.

### The LinearRegression_2 project:
It contains the notebook file that uses the Ecommerce dataset to predict the yearly amount spent by user on Ecommerce websites by using the 'Yearly Amount Spent' as the dependent varible and 'Time on App','Time on Web','Session Length'.
Dataset used in this project has been uploaded.

### The LogisticRegression_1 Project:
It contains the notebook file that uses the Titanic dataset to predict the assets of survived passengers by using the Passenger Class, Age, No of Siblings and Fare as independent variables. The data has to be cleaned before using and certain columns have to be removed as they have to many missing values.
Dataset has been uploaded for further refrence.

### The LogisticRegression_2 Project:
It contains the notebook file that uses the Advertising dataset to predict the that a user clicked on an Advertisement or not by using the Daily Time spent, Age, Are, Income, Daily Internet Usage and Gender as independent variables. 
Dataset has been uploaded for further refrence.

### The KNN_1:
It contains a notebook file that uses the Classsified Data Dataset and implements K Nearest Neighbour Algorithm. The error rate for each k value is calculated and compared with the Target class. On further calculations it is noticed that for K=17 gives the best possible classification results.

### The KNN_2:
It contains a notebook file that uses the KNN_Project Dataset and uses the KNN Algorithm. The data is is trained and tested and error rates for a certain range of k values is calculated and compared with Target Class, on observation, the K=30 value gives the best possible accuracy.

### The RF_1:
It contains a notebook file that uses the Kyphosis Dataset which has the Age and number columns so that the number of vertebras damaged can be predicted from the given data. It uses 2 classifiers , DecisionTree and Random Forest to compute the predictions.
Relevant Dataset has also been uploaded for refrence.

### The RF_2:
It contains a notebook file that uses the Loan Dataset to predict if a user pays the loan amount completely or not. It uses 2 classsifiers the Decision tree and Random Forest algorithm.
The Dataset has been uploaded to work on.

### The SVM_1:
It contains a notebook file that uses the Breast Cancer Dataset from sklearn and has target values of its own. The Support Vector Classifier is used to meet the respective Target classes, afterwards the Grid Search classifier has been used with parameters like c and Gamma and outputs were predicted. 


### The SVM_2:
It contains a notebook file that uses the Iris Flower Dataset from Seaborn , the flowers have been classified as Sentosa or not on the basis of other characterstics like sepal width, sepal radius, etc. The Support Vector Classifier has been used initially and later the GridSearch has been used by giving parameters of C and Gamma and output is predicted.

### The KMC_1:
It contains a notebook file that uses the data made by making blobs from the sklearn library. The initial number of clusters is 4 and on increasing the number of clusters better classification can be observed.

### The KMC_2:
It contains the notebook file that uses the College_data dataset which classfies whether the private college students or government college students have better jobs, graduation rates and many more factors.
Dataset has been uploaded for further reference.

### The KNN_1:
It contains the notebook file that uses the Classified Data dataset which classifies the columns according to the required TARGET class.
The number of neighbours value is 1, but on analysing the Graph we conclude that n_neighbours=17 gives us the best classification results.
Dataset has been also uploaded for further reference.

### The KNN_2:
It contains the notebook file that uses the dataset which classifies the data to the required target class. Initially the number of neighbours is 1 but in analyzing it can be found that best elbow in the curve is found around 30. Also increaing the n value will cause more clusters and that is not acceptable.
Dataset is also uploaded.

### The Recommendation project:
It contains the notebook file that uses the movie_list dataset which contains column like rating,movie_id,title,etc. For this project we use two movies StarWars and Liar Liar. We find the movies similar to them using the correlation function with other all the movies. Lastly the movies can be computed by highest corelation with other movies.
Dataset has been uploaded.

### The NLP Project:
It contains the notebook file that uses the SMSCollection dataset and hence Classifies a particular sms as Spam or not. 
Dataset has been uploaded for further reference.
