# Basic ML Project 

### The first_project and second_project:
It contains Exploratery Data Analysis application and libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn and Matplotlib have been used. 
The projects potray plotting Graphs using seaborn, matplotlib and Data analysis, using dummy varibles and Data Cleaning methods to set up a usable and unbiased Dataset for Algorithms.
Datasets used in the projects above have also been uploaded.

### The LinearRegression_1 project:
It contains the notebook file that uses the USA Housing Dataset to predict the coefficents using the dependent variable 'Price' and the independent variable as 'No of Rooms','Poplulation,'Income','Area',etc.
Dataset used in the project above has also been uploaded.

### The LinearRegression_2 project:
It contains the notebook file that uses the Ecommerce dataset to predict the yearly amount spent by user on Ecommerce websites by using the 'Yearly Amount Spent' as the dependent varible and 'Time on App','Time on Web','Session Length'.
Dataset used in this project has been uploaded.
