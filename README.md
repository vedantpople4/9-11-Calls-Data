# Basic ML work
The repo is a basic project made by using the 9/11 Calls Dataset.
The notebook file includes applications of functions and various plot commands using the NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
However this is my first shot at Machine Learning, the flexibility of libraries has amazed me to a great extent.
I am currently working on projects and various Algorithms, will surely come up with various projects using them.
